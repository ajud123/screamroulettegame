so basically
upload the files depedning on what we can upload
if we can only like upload one file, upload windows_packed.exe
if we can multiple, we could upload windows.exe and windows.pck as an archive or whatever
same goes for linux aswell
although im not sure if theres an actual difference between the packed and non packed versions
so for convenience ig just use the packed one
